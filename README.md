# ThumbsUp! Trackball v4

A PCB-based finger-operated trackball, inspired by Elecom EX-G left hand trackball, Ploopy Nano trackball, and my own ThumbsUp! Trackball v3.
 
Off-the-shelf ProMicro-style MCUs is considered: 
- nice!nano v2 (and clones) with ZMK-based firmware - wireless/wired/BT/dongle.

~~34 mm ball, same as in Elecom EX-G, or ~~44 mm, or 52.5mm as in Elecom Huge, or 55mm balls.
For bearings - uxcell 2.5mm Ceramic Bearing Balls, ZrO2 Zirconium Oxide Ball, again, the same as used to improve my Elecom trackballs.
Bearings to be implanted into PCBs, no 3D-printed ball shroud/holder.

A few buttons scattered on top of the boards, not sure about their bindings yet, so let's say 6 of them at least + 4 for reset/ZMK.Studio/BT Reset/BT Next.
I.e. let's keep the buttons of v3 for now.
(As of rev.2 there are 8 "large" buttons, 3 programmable and 1 reset low-profile buttons.)

Rev.1 with 44 mm Ball:
